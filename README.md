what needs to be polished/Upgraded or what need to be created.


Completed:

          1) Basic Snap Shot Function and Recognition for:
               a) Rings
               b) Score
               c) Lives
               d) Act Beginning and End

          2) Validation of Ring,Score, lives and Act values
          3) Recognition that Sonic 3 & Knuckles is ready to play
          4) Function/Functions to handles the generation of action
          5) Rough Documentation of all current files
          6) Functions/Functions to load/save data off each play attempt made by the computer

          6)Explanation of projects at the bottom of this read me

Needs Created:

          1) Functions for the evaluation of a generation and creation of a new generation based on said evaluations*
          2) Functions to facilitate automatically naming a new generation based on a previous name

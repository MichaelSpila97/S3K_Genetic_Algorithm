# Sonic3-K_Game_AI

Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to create a AI or Bot that can compenetly play the sega genisis classic Sonic 3 & Knuckles.
The AI will use a combination of image analysis and action analysis to function. By the end the project it should be able to
at least get through the first act of the game, Angel Island zone, with no issues. Below is a list of what has been completed,
what needs to be polished/Upgraded or what need to be created.


Completed:

          1) Basic Snap Shot Function and Recognition for:
               a) Rings
               b) Score
               c) Lives
               d) Act Beginning and End
               
          2) Validation of Ring,Score, lives and Act values

          2) Documentation
          3) Better File Names
          4) Add variable in act class to faciliate the varition of the multiple action delays in spindash and jump_sheild
          
Needs Created:

          1) Functions/Functions to load/save data off each play attempt made by the computer*
          2) Model for evaluating the fitness of a computers play attempt 
          3) Fuctions/Function to score said model 
          4) Functions/Function to create new computer AI off of the fittess AI data from the last generation
          5) Way to detect enemies and object on screens
          6) Good Gui for easy control of the project for running tests
